üëâ **Why is `isCofeeReady.then(ready).catch(outOfStock);` working even though `isCofeeReady` is not explicitly called like a function?**  

### **Answer: `isCofeeReady` is a Promise, Not a Function**  
When you write:
```javascript
let isCofeeReady = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... });
```
- **You are not creating a function**; instead, you are creating a **Promise instance**.
- The **Promise automatically starts executing** as soon as it is created.  
- This is different from functions, which run **only when called**.

---

### **How Promises Work Internally**
Unlike a function, which needs an explicit call (`myFunction()`), a Promise **immediately starts executing** its logic when it's created.  

#### **Step-by-Step Execution**
```javascript
let isCofeeReady = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  console.log("Checking coffee availability...");

  let isCofeeReadyy = true; // Simulating coffee availability

  if (isCofeeReadyy) {
    resolve(); // This marks the Promise as "fulfilled"
  } else {
    reject(); // This marks the Promise as "rejected"
  }
});
```
1. As soon as `new Promise(...)` is created, it **runs immediately**.
2. The `console.log("Checking coffee availability...");` will execute **right away**.
3. If `isCofeeReadyy = true`, the `resolve();` function is called, meaning the Promise is **fulfilled**.
4. If `isCofeeReadyy = false`, the `reject();` function is called, meaning the Promise is **rejected**.

### **Key Difference: Function vs Promise**
| Feature          | Function (`myFunction()`) | Promise (`new Promise(...)`) |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Needs explicit call?** | ‚úÖ Yes (`myFunction()`) | ‚ùå No, runs immediately |
| **Runs once or continuously?** | ‚úÖ Runs only when called | ‚úÖ Starts automatically |
| **Asynchronous handling?** | ‚ùå No (unless manually async) | ‚úÖ Yes, supports `.then()` & `.catch()` |

---

### **Common Mistake: Calling `isCofeeReady();`**
At the end of your code, you wrote:
```javascript
isCofeeReady(); // ‚ùå ERROR: isCofeeReady is NOT a function!
```
- Since `isCofeeReady` is a **Promise**, not a function, calling it like `isCofeeReady();` will throw an error.  
- Instead, you should use `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle it.

‚úÖ **Correct way to handle the Promise:**
```javascript
isCofeeReady.then(ready).catch(outOfStock);
```
- `.then(ready)` will execute `ready()` if the Promise resolves.
- `.catch(outOfStock)` will execute `outOfStock()` if the Promise rejects.

---

### **Conclusion: Why `isCofeeReady` Works Without Calling It**
‚úÖ A **function** must be **called explicitly** to execute.  
‚úÖ A **Promise** **starts executing automatically** when it is created.  
‚úÖ `isCofeeReady.then(ready).catch(outOfStock);` works because `isCofeeReady` is a **Promise that is already running**, and we're just waiting for its result.
